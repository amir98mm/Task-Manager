# Task-Manager
This program is a console-based task manager that allows users to manage their tasks through a simple menu interface. Users can add new tasks, remove existing ones, print all tasks, and change the status of a task from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done".

The program stores the tasks in a file called tasks.txt and automatically loads them when the program starts. When the user exits the program, the current list of tasks is saved back to the file. Each task has a name, description, priority level, due date, and status.

The task manager is implemented in C++ and uses object-oriented programming concepts. It demonstrates the use of classes, objects, and file I/O in C++.

Usage
To use the task manager, simply run the program in a terminal or command prompt. The program will display a menu with options for adding, removing, printing, and changing the status of tasks. Follow the prompts to perform each action.
